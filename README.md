# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project was completed as part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
The objective of this task was to build a **Linear Regression model** to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

## 📌 Project Overview

House price prediction is an important real-world problem in the real estate domain.  
In this project, I implemented a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on features such as:

- Square Footage  
- Number of Bedrooms  
- Number of Bathrooms

## 📊 Dataset

- **Dataset Used:** [House Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- The dataset includes:
  - House size (square footage)  
  - Number of bedrooms  
  - Number of bathrooms  
  - Price of the house

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded the dataset into Colab
   - Handled missing values (if any)
   - Selected features for model training

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized data distributions
   - Checked correlations among features

3. **Model Training**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets
   - Applied **Linear Regression**
   - Trained the model on the training data

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Predicted house prices for test data
   - Calculated accuracy metrics (R² Score, MAE, MSE)

5. **Visualization**
   - Plotted regression line and predictions

## 📈 Results

- The model was able to predict house prices with a good level of accuracy.
- Evaluation metrics showed that the **Linear Regression** approach works well for this dataset.
